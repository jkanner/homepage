	  <h1>N. Lake Ave Protected Bike Lanes</h1>

	  <h3>Let's make Lake Ave work for everyone</h3>

	  Pasadenaâ€™s Department of Transportation recently released its
	  conceptual design for the
	  <a href='https://www.cityofpasadena.net/transportation/transportation-improvements/north-lake-avenue/'>
	  North Lake Avenue Traffic and Pedestrian
	  Safety Enhancement Plan</a>.  The plan calls for improved
	  pedestrian safety on Lake Avenue, north of the 210.
	  <br/><br/>
	  The plan is a great start, but we believe it can be
	  further improved by:

	  <ul>
	    <li> Adding protected bike lanes for safe, clean travel </li>
	    <li> Adding additional trees, to help make this a comfortable
	      place to walk and ride </li>
	  </ul>

	  We believe these additions will:

	  <ul>
	    <li> Increase biking and walking in Pasadena </li>
	    <li> Increase access to the Lake Street metro station </li>
	    <li> Improve safety for the neighborhood </li>
	    <li> Increase business for neighborhood restaurants and
	      shops </li>
	  </ul>
	  

	  Providing safe places to bike or scooter helps everyone in the
	  city.  Increased biking leads to less traffic and less
	  congestion, so there's more room on the road for motorists.
	  Replacing short car trips with bikes or scooters can also have
	  huge benefits for the rider, including improving health and
	  saving money.  For neighborhood residents, space for bikes
	  means decreased traffic noise, safer streets, and a whole new
	  way to explore and enjoy our beautiful city.

	  A protected bike lane in Temple City.  Physical barriers
	  seperate the bike lane from road traffic.  This creates a
	  safe place to ride, providing a better street for everyone.
	  Protected bike lanes like this would be a great addition to
	  Lake avenue.
